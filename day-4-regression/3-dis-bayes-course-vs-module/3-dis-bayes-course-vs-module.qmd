## What Are You Teaching?

- A Bayesian course vs a Bayesian module in a course?

- It can be your plans

- Let's hear from 2-3 of you!

## Analyses of Bayesian Courses
::: nonincremental
- Results from [a recent The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika

- Out of 51 Bayesian courses from various STEM fields
:::

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 500, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("TAStable.png")
```
# Small Group Discussion

## Format and Length

- About 30 minutes

- 3-4 small groups, each led by one Instructor/TA

- Grouped by: 
    - Bayesian courses only 
    - Bayesian modules only
    - Bayesian courses and modules

- Assign a note-taker; if okay, please share notes with us afterwards

- Assign a reporter for large group sharing (3 minutes per group)

- Feel free to use our prepared questions and feel free to come up with your own


## Discussion Questions

::: nonincremental
1. [The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika includes the following breakdown of topics by area for a Bayesian course. What do you think of them?
:::
```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 500, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("TAStopics.png")
```

2. [The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika includes
the following sample weekly schedules for a Bayesian course. What do you think of them?

```
## Discussion Questions

3. What has been your biggest challenge of teaching a Bayesian course/module? Have you figured out some solutions to it?

4. What is your favorite topic when teaching a Bayesian course/module?

5. If introducing a Bayesian module in an introductory/intermediate/advanced-level course in your field, what would be your plans, in terms of topic, data, computing, and modeling?

6. What is the one challenge you would like to get help with from BATS bootcamp?

# Large Group Sharing

## Format and Length

- About 25 minutes

- We will record this portion for sharing later. Okay?

- Each group reports back for 3 minutes

- Open discussion for remaining time
