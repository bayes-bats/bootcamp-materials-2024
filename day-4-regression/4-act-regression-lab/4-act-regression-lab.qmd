## Goals for the Afternoon

-   Consider learning objectives and goals for a regression modeling lab

-   Identify interesting data to use in a linear regression lab

-   Write lab prompts and (time permitting) solutions for class!

## One Example: Albert and Hu

Consider exercises 19-20 in [Chapter 11 of Probability and Bayesian Modeling by Albert and Hu](https://bayesball.github.io/BOOK/simple-linear-regression#exercises). As a group, we'll talk through how we might incorporate these into a lab.


## Sample Lab Materials

-   You may also wish to review the exercises on humidity and (if time permits) penguins in [section 9.10.2 of Bayes Rules!  ](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-9.html#exercises-8).

-   Small groups: based on topical interests, split into groups and develop lab activities!
