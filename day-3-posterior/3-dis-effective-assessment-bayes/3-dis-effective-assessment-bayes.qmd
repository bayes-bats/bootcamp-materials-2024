## What Assessment Tools Are You Using?

- Anything related to statistics and/or Bayesian statistics

- It can be your plans

- Let's hear from 2-3 of you!

## Analyses of Assessments
::: nonincremental
- Results from [a recent The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika

- Out of 29 syllabi from various STEM fields

# Small Group Discussion

## Format and Length

- About 30 minutes

- 3-4 small groups, each led by one Instructor/TA

- Random assignment; get to know people from a different discipline!

- Assign a note-taker; if okay, please share notes with us afterwards

- Assign a reporter for large group sharing (3 minutes per group)

- Feel free to use our prepared questions and feel free to come up with your own


## Discussion Questions

1. [The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika includes the following recommendations for assessments of a Bayesian course. What do you think of them?

    - Include a data analysis portion in a homework assignment and in an exam
    - Include a course project component in course assessments
    - Include formative assessments such as quizzes (low to no-grade contribution) to get students to do drill and practice exercises
    - Be created with assessment tools
    - In addition to lectures, use real data in every assessment when possible

## Discussion Questions

2. What assessment tool(s) you have found to be most effective. Why and what advice do you have for someone to give it a try?

3. What assessment tool(s) you have found to be least effective. Why and do you have solutions to improve it/them?

4. What is the one challenge you would like to get help with from BATS bootcamp?

# Large Group Sharing

## Format and Length

- About 25 minutes

- We will record this portion for sharing later. Okay?

- Each group reports back for 3 minutes

- Open discussion for remaining time
