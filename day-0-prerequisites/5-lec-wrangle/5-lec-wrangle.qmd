Three solutions to a single problem

:::

##

What is the average of 4, 8, 16 approximately?

##

1.What is the average of **4, 8, 16** approximately?


2.What is the **average** of 4, 8, 16 approximately?


3.What is the average of 4, 8, 16 **approximately**?

##

:::{.font75}

Solution 1: Functions within Functions

:::


##

```{r}
c(4, 8, 16)
```



<hr>

```{r}
mean(c(4, 8, 16))
```



<hr>

```{r}
round(mean(c(4, 8, 16)))
```

##

**Problem with writing functions within functions**

Things will get messy and more difficult to read and debug as we deal with more complex operations on data.


## 

:::{.font75} 

Solution 2: Creating Objects

:::

##

```{r}
numbers <- c(4, 8, 16)
numbers
```


<hr>

```{r}
avg_number <- mean(numbers)
avg_number
```



<hr>

```{r}
round(avg_number)
```


##

**Problem with creating many objects**

We will end up with too many objects in `Environment`. 



##

:::{.font75}

Solution 3: The (forward) Pipe Operator %>%

:::

<hr>

:::{.font75}

Shortcut: <br>Ctrl (Command) + Shift + M

:::

##

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}


```{r}
c(4, 8, 16) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  round()
```

:::



::: {.column width="50%"}

Combine 4, 8, and 16 `and then`  
Take the mean   `and then`  
Round the output

:::

::::

##

The output of the first function is the first argument of the second function.


##

Do you recall composite functions such as $f \circ g(x)$?


Now we have $f \circ g \circ h (x)$ or `round(mean(c(4, 8, 16)))`



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r eval = FALSE}
h(x) %>% 
  g() %>% 
  f()
```

:::


::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r eval = FALSE}
c(4, 8, 16) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  round()
```

Subsetting data frames

:::


##

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
lapd <- read_csv(here::here("day-0-prerequisites/5-lec-wrangle/data/Police_Payroll.csv")) 
```


```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

##

```{r}

lapd <- clean_names(lapd)
glimpse(lapd)
```


## subsetting variables/columns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.001.jpeg")
```



`select()`



## subsetting observations/rows

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.002.jpeg")
```

`slice()` and `filter()` 

##

`select` is used to select certain variables in the data frame. 


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}


```{r}
select(lapd, year, base_pay)
```

:::



::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  select(year, base_pay)
```

:::

::::

##

`select` can also be used to drop certain variables if used with a negative sign.

```{r}
select(lapd, -row_id, -department_title)
```


## Selection helpers

`starts_with()`  
`ends_with()`  
`contains()`  

##

```{r}
select(lapd, starts_with("q"))
```

##

```{r}
select(lapd, ends_with("pay"))
```

##

```{r}
select(lapd, contains("pay"))
```



## subsetting variables/columns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.001.jpeg")
```



`select()`



## subsetting observations/rows

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.002.jpeg")
```

`slice()` and `filter()` 

##

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

`slice()` subsetting rows based on a row number.

The data below include all the rows from third to seventh. Including third and seventh.

```{r}
slice(lapd, 3:7)
```

:::


::: {.column width="45%"}

`filter()` subsetting rows based on a condition.

The data below includes rows when the recorded year is 2018.

```{r}
filter(lapd, year == 2018)
```

:::

::::

##

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Q. According to [datausa.io](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/los-angeles-ca#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20CA,%2462%2C474%2C%20a%203.78%25%20increase.) Los Angeles had a median household income of $62474 in 2018. How many LAPD staff members had a base pay higher than $62474 in year 2018 according to this data?
<hr>

Median household income is **not** the same thing as median employee income. Our aim is data wrangling and not necessarily statistical analysis for now.

##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018 & base_pay > 62474)
```


##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018 & base_pay > 62474) %>% 
  nrow()
```

##

Q. How many observations are available between 2013 and 2015 including 2013 and 2015?


```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year >= 2013 & year <= 2015)
```

##

Q. How many observations are available between 2013 and 2015 including 2013 and 2015?

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year >= 2013 & year <= 2015) %>% 
  nrow()
```

##

Q. How many LAPD staff were employed full time in 2018?



```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(employment_type == "Full Time" & year == 2018) %>% 
  nrow()
```

##

We have done all sorts of selections, slicing, filtering on `lapd` but it has not changed at all. Why do you think so?

```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

##

Moving forward we are only going to focus on year 2018, and use `job_class_title`, `employment_type`, and `base_pay`. Let's clean our data accordingly and move on with the smaller `lapd` data that we need.

##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```

##

```{r}
lapd <- 
  lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```


##


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
lapd <- read_csv(here::here("day-0-prerequisites/5-lec-wrangle/data/Police_Payroll.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```



```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

**Goal**: 

Create a new variable called `base_pay_k` that represents `base_pay` in thousand dollars.

##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_k = base_pay/1000)
```

##

```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

**Goal**: 

Create a new variable called `base_pay_level` which has `Less Than 0`, `No Income`, `Less than Median and Greater than 0` and `Greater than Median`. We will consider $62474 as the median (from previous lecture).

##

Let's first check to see there is anyone earning exactly the median value.

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(base_pay == 62474)
```

##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) 
```

##

We can't really see what we have created 

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) %>% 
  select(base_pay_level)
```


##

We can use pipes with ggplot too! 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r eval = FALSE}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) %>% 
  select(base_pay_level) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = base_pay_level)) +
  geom_bar()
```

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r echo = FALSE}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(base_pay_level = case_when(
    base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
    base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
    base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
    base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) %>% 
  select(base_pay_level) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = base_pay_level)) +
  geom_bar()
```

:::

::::

##

```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

**Goal**: 

Make `job_class_title` and `employment_type` factor variables. 


##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  mutate(employment_type = as.factor(employment_type),
         job_class_title = as.factor(job_class_title)) 
```

##

`as.factor()` - makes a vector factor  
`as.numeric()` - makes a vector numeric  
`as.integer()` - makes a vector integer  
`as.double()` - makes a vector double  
`as.character()` - makes a vector character  

##

Once again we did not "save"
anything into `lapd`. As we work on data cleaning it makes sense not to "save" the data frames. Once we see the final data frame we want then we can "save" (i.e. overwrite) it.

##

In your lecture notes, you can do all the changes in this lecture in one long set of piped code. That's the beauty of piping!

```{r eval=FALSE}
lapd <- 
  lapd %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay) %>% 
    mutate(employment_type = as.factor(employment_type),
           job_class_title = as.factor(job_class_title),
           base_pay_level = case_when(
             base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
             base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
             base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
             base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
lapd <- 
  read_csv(here::here("day-0-prerequisites/5-lec-wrangle/data/Police_Payroll.csv")) %>%  
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay) %>% 
    mutate(employment_type = as.factor(employment_type),
           job_class_title = as.factor(job_class_title),
           base_pay_level = case_when(
             base_pay < 0 ~ "Less than 0", 
             base_pay == 0 ~ "No Income",
             base_pay < 62474 & base_pay > 0 ~ "Less than Median, Greater than 0",
             base_pay > 62474 ~ "Greater than Median")) 
```


## Word of caution

The functions `clean_names()`, `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()` all take a data frame as the first argument. Even though we do not see it, the data frame is piped through from the previous step of code at each step. 
When we use these functions without the `%>%` we have to include the data frame explicitly.


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Data frame is used as the first argument
```{r}
clean_names(lapd)
```

:::



::: {.column width="40%"}
Data frame is piped

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  clean_names()
```

Aggregating Categorical Data

:::

##

Categorical data are summarized with **counts** or **proportions**

##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  count(employment_type)
```


##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  count(employment_type) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
```




## Mean


```{r}
summarize(lapd, 
          mean_base_pay = mean(base_pay))
```




## Mean is not a good measure when the data are skewed

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=6}
ggplot(lapd, aes(x = base_pay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000)
```





## Median

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
summarize(lapd, 
          median(base_pay))
```

:::



::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
median(lapd$base_pay)
```

:::

::::



## Quantiles

```{r}
summarize(lapd, quantile(base_pay, c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75)))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
q1 <- summarize(lapd, quantiles = quantile(base_pay, c(0.25))) %>% 
  pull()
```


##

Recall that we use multiple functions such as `mean()` and `median` within the summarize function

```{r}
summarize(lapd,
          mean_base_pay = mean(base_pay),
          med_base_pay = median(base_pay))
```

##

:::{.font75}
Aggregating Data by Groups

:::

##

`group_by()`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.003.jpeg")
```

`group_by()` separates the data frame by the groups. Any action following `group_by()` will be completed for each group separately.

##

Q. What is the median salary for each employment type?

##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  group_by(employment_type)
```

##

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  group_by(employment_type) %>% 
  summarize(med_base_pay = median(base_pay))
```



##

We can also remind ourselves how many staff members there were in each group.

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  group_by(employment_type) %>% 
  summarize(med_base_pay = median(base_pay),
            count = n())
```

Note that `n()` does not take any arguments.
