## Unordered list {#ul}

You can use typical markdown formatting, such as:

-   **bold** text
-   *italic* text
-   `code-looking`text
-   [link](https://bayes-bats.github.io/website/)

## Ordered list

.. and such as:

1.  [important]{.underline} text

2.  Superscripted^1^

3.  Subscripted~1~

## Figures

There are at least two ways you can include figures:

```         
![The Bayes BATS logo (included with Markdown) ](img/logo-white.png){fig-alt="A hex logo with a yellow background, a marron border and the text Bayes BATS in blue, with a black bat icon underneath" fig-align="center" width="100"}
```

![The Bayes BATS logo (included with Markdown)](img/logo-white.png){fig-alt="A hex logo with a yellow background, a marron border and the text Bayes BATS in blue, with a black bat icon underneath" fig-align="center" width="100"}

```{r}
#| echo: fenced # (this is for displaying the r chunk and chunk options when rendered!)
#| fig-cap: The Bayes BATS logo (included with R chunk)
#| out-width: 15%
knitr::include_graphics("img/logo-white.png")
```

## Code chunks

### Classic code chunk

```{r}
2 + 2
```


### Code chunk that only shows output

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 + 2
```

### Code chunk that only shows the code (but is not evaluated)

```{r}
#| eval: false
2 + 2
```

### Cool code that unfolds and shows you code only if you want!

```{r}
#| echo: fenced # (this is for displaying the r chunk and chunk options when rendered!)
#| code-fold: true
2 + 2
```

### Long code chunks (better not?)

Note that if your code is exceptionally long, it can be visualized by scrolling (what number is added at the end?)

```{r}
#| echo: fenced # (this is for displaying the r chunk and chunk options when rendered!)
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 888888
```

## Columns

### Two equally-sized columns

::: columns
::: column
This is the left column!

```{r}
2+2
```
:::

::: column
This is the right column!

```{r}
2*2
```
:::
:::

### Two differently-sized columns

::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}
This is the left column!

```{r}
2+2
```
:::

::: {.column width="75%"}
This is the right column!

```{r}
2*2
```
:::
:::

### Three columns?

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
This is the left column!

```{r}
2+2
```
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
This is the **central** column!

```{r}
2*2
```
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
This is the **right** column!

```{r}
2^2
```
:::
:::

### Two columns with some space between them (_little hacky_)

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
This is the left column!

```{r}
2+2
```
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
This is the **right** column!

```{r}
2^2
```
:::

## Callouts

Cute ways to highlight something (from [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html#callout-types))

::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Tip with Title, that collapses!" collapse="true"}
This is a callout with a title and that also collapses.
:::

## Cross references 

You might want to link to a section or subsection within the same Quarto document.

Assign a section ID to the header by including `#ID` after the title header (e.g. `## Unordered list {#ul}`).

Then you can cross reference it:
See [Unordered list](#ul) for how to make an unordered list.

## Tabsets

These are cool ways to divide content into clickable tabs.

::: panel-tabset

## Tab 1

Content for the first tab.

## Tab 2

Content for the second tab.

:::

## Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference[^1]

[^1]: Here is the first footnote.

Here is another footnote reference[^2]

[^2]: Here is the second footnote.

## Margins

You can put information in the margins of a document:

::: column-margin
Content for the margin.
:::

### You can place output in the margins

This table to the right is the output of a code chunk!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| column: margin

mtcars[1:6, 1:3]
```
